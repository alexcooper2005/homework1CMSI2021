# Compound Interest Calculator

## Overview

The **Compound Interest Calculator** is a web application that allows users to calculate compound interest based on their inputs. It provides an easy-to-use interface where users can enter their principal amount, annual percentage rate (APR), period, and number of years to see both the interest earned and the total amount accumulated.

## Features

- Calculate compound interest based on user input.
- Adjust APR dynamically using a slider.
- Display the interest earned and total amount in real-time.

## Files

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that structures the web page.
- **`style.css`**: The CSS file that styles the web page, including layout and visual design.
- **`script.js`**: The JavaScript file that handles the functionality of the compound interest calculations and updates the UI based on user input.

## Criticism Addressed

- **Lack of Index Element**: I simply addressed this by adding a the <title> element to my index.html
- **No Grid, Flex, or Margin**: I addressed this by adding a grid with flex that makes the tables in my site adjust accordingly to the page space. If you shrink the page, the title, footer, and main calculator box will condense to fit accordingly. In addition, a margin was added, reducing clutter.
- **No Transition or Animation**: Using some resources I found on the internet as to making moving backgrounds using CSS, I made an animation that is layers of stripes that move diagonally through the screen. Before this the background was gradient, which is still the case within individual boxes. But overall, the background is more exciting given that it moves.
- **No Transform**: I added a transform where if you hover the mouse over the central calculator box, it slightly increases in size, making the site feel more interactive.
- **No Text Shadow**: I applied text-shadow to all text seen throughout the site, making it look more visually appealing.
- **No Footer Link**: I added a side link to have a hypothetical link that says "learn more", giving the impression of professionalism in this website.
